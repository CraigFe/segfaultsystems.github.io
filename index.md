Segfault Systems solves complex problems in scalable systems using type-safe
programming language abstractions. Our language of choice is OCaml, a statically
typed functional programming language.

We lead the development of the Multicore OCaml programming language and its
associated developer tools. We work closely with our academic and industrial
partners worldwide to advance science and deliver products.

Our work is primarily made available as free and liberally licensed open-source
software.

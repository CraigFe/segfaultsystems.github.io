Segfault Systems solves complex problems in scalable systems using type-safe
programming language abstractions. Our language of choice is
[OCaml](http://ocaml.org/), a statically typed functional programming language.

We lead the development of the [Multicore
OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore) programming language and its
associated developer tools. We work closely with our
[academic](https://ocamllabs.io/) and [industrial](https://www.janestreet.com/)
[partners](https://tarides.com/) worldwide to advance science and deliver
products.

Our work is primarily made available as free and liberally licensed open-source
software.
